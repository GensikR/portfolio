# Interactive Personal Portfolio

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an **interactive personal portfolio** built with **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Firebase Firestore**.

- **Projects Section**: Each project includes overview, requirements, visuals, use cases, and demo links.
- **Admin Section**: Secure area to add/edit project documentation, upload demos, and control project visibility.
